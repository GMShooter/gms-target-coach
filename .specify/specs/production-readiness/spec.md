# Feature Specification: Production Readiness Transformation

**Feature Branch**: `feature/production-readiness`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Transform the current non-functional 'SOTA Demo' MVP into a robust, dazzling, and production-ready demonstration that meets the highest standards of quality and user experience"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Authentication Flow (Priority: P1)

User can securely authenticate with email/password and be redirected to the demo page with their session properly established and user record created in the database.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the gateway to all functionality - without it, no user can access the application. This is blocking all other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new user account, logging in, and verifying the user appears in the users table and is redirected to /demo page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on login page, **When** they enter valid email/password and click submit, **Then** they are redirected to /demo page and see "SIGNED_IN" event in console
2. **Given** user enters invalid credentials, **When** they click submit, **Then** they see appropriate error message without page crash
3. **Given** user successfully authenticates, **When** they check the users table, **Then** a new record exists with their email and proper UUID

### User Story 2 - Real-Time Analysis Engine (Priority: P1)

User can start a live analysis session that continuously fetches frames, analyzes them for shots, and updates the UI in real-time with shot overlays and metrics.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that demonstrates the SOTA technology - without it, the demo has no value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a session and verifying that frames are processed, shots are detected, and metrics update without errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on demo page, **When** they click "Start Analysis", **Then** analysis begins and frame counter increments
2. **Given** analysis is running, **When** identical frames are received, **Then** "No frame change detected" is logged and analysis is skipped
3. **Given** analysis is running, **When** API call takes longer than 15 seconds, **Then** analysis stops gracefully with timeout error
4. **Given** shots are detected, **When** analysis completes, **Then** shot overlays appear on target and metrics update in real-time

### User Story 3 - Production UI Polish (Priority: P2)

User experiences a visually stunning, intuitive interface with smooth animations, proper error handling, and responsive design that works across all devices.

**Why this priority**: Visual polish and user experience are critical for stakeholder approval and user adoption - a functional but ugly application will not be accepted.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the demo page on different screen sizes and verifying all UI elements render properly with smooth animations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses demo page, **When** page loads, **Then** all animations are smooth and no layout shifts occur
2. **Given** user is on mobile device, **When** they access demo page, **Then** layout is responsive and all functionality is accessible
3. **Given** error occurs during analysis, **When** error happens, **Then** user sees friendly error message with recovery options
4. **Given** metrics update, **When** values change, **Then** numbers animate smoothly and charts update without flicker

---

### User Story 4 - Production Deployment (Priority: P1)

Application can be deployed to production environment with all environment variables properly configured, all services functional, and monitoring in place.

**Why this priority**: Production deployment is the ultimate goal - without it, the demo cannot be shared with stakeholders or users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying to staging/production and verifying all endpoints respond correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** production build is created, **When** deployed, **Then** all pages load without errors
2. **Given** edge functions are deployed, **When** called, **Then** they return proper responses with correct CORS headers
3. **Given** monitoring is configured, **When** errors occur, **Then** they are logged and alerts are triggered
4. **Given** user accesses production URL, **When** they use the application, **Then** all functionality works as expected

## Edge Cases

- What happens when network connection is lost during analysis?
- How does system handle Roboflow API rate limiting or downtime?
- What happens when Supabase Edge Functions timeout?
- How does system handle browser compatibility issues?
- What happens when user session expires during analysis?
