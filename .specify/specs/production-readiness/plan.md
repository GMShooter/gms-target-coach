# Implementation Plan: Production Readiness Transformation

**Branch**: `feature/production-readiness` | **Date**: 2025-10-29 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/production-readiness/spec.md`

## Summary

Transform GMShoot v2 from current prototype state (25% readiness) to production-ready application by removing all mock implementations, fixing authentication system, implementing real-time analysis engine, adding production UI polish, and ensuring robust deployment infrastructure. The plan follows GMShoot v2 Constitution requirements with focus on hardware-first development, real-time analysis pipeline, test-driven development, component architecture, and security-first approach.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, React 18.2+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Supabase (Auth, Edge Functions, Database), Roboflow API, React 18+, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL via Supabase  
**Testing**: Jest (unit), Cypress (E2E), React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Web application (browser-based)  
**Project Type**: Single/web  
**Performance Goals**: <2s analysis latency, 90+ Lighthouse score, 60fps UI updates  
**Constraints**: <200ms API response time, <100MB memory usage, real-time capable  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page demo application with real-time analysis

|------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| None | N/A | All requirements follow GMShoot v2 Constitution |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Cleanup (Week 1)
**Goal**: Remove all mock implementations and establish clean codebase foundation
**Deliverables**: Zero mock code, clean ESLint report, working authentication

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Week 2)
**Goal**: Implement real-time analysis engine with proper error handling
**Deliverables**: Working analysis pipeline, frame deduplication, timeout handling

### Phase 3: UI Polish & UX (Week 3)
**Goal**: Create stunning, responsive interface with smooth animations
**Deliverables**: Polished demo page, responsive design, error handling UI

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Week 4)
**Goal**: Deploy to production with monitoring and documentation
**Deliverables**: Production deployment, monitoring setup, complete documentation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- 0% mock implementation in production code
- Zero ESLint errors and warnings
- 100% Jest test pass rate
- <2s analysis latency
- 90+ Lighthouse score

### Business Metrics
- Users can authenticate and access demo in <10 seconds
- Real-time analysis works smoothly without errors
- Stakeholder approval of demo quality

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Hardware Integration Complexity**: Real hardware may not behave as expected
   - Mitigation: Create comprehensive hardware simulation and testing
   
2. **Third-party API Dependencies**: Roboflow API changes or downtime
   - Mitigation: Implement fallback mechanisms and monitoring

3. **Timeline Pressure**: 4-week timeline is aggressive
   - Mitigation: Regular progress reviews and scope adjustments

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Real-time processing may impact performance
   - Mitigation: Implement performance monitoring and optimization
   
2. **Browser Compatibility**: New features may not work in all browsers
