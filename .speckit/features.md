i have besides your created @/.specify/templates. i want you to user this plan and elaborate and deepen it. beside it i want you to analyse my current logic, and user functionality to see that it has complex and methodical plan as follows:

Executive Summary
Your project is characterized by exceptionally detailed planning, documentation, and a clear, ambitious vision. The Spec-Kit is professional grade, outlining a robust, scalable application. However, there is a critical and immediate disconnect between this comprehensive plan and the practical, ground-truth requirements of your technical partner, Moritz.
The current state of the application, as revealed by previous test logs and your own messages, is unstable, with a critical authentication failure being the primary blocker. While you have been rebuilding the application and defining its architecture, the implementation has not yet integrated the most crucial component: the API for the physical hardware (Raspberry Pi) that Moritz is developing.
The central discrepancy is this: your documentation and current efforts are focused on a web-centric architecture (React -> Supabase/Roboflow), while your partners' immediate need is for a hardware-integrated system (React -> Raspberry Pi -> Roboflow).
1. Critical Discrepancies: Ground Truth vs. Current Implementation
This section addresses your core request to find missing or wrongly implemented features based on the partner conversation.
Discrepancy #1: The Hardware API Integration is Missing (CRITICAL)
Ground Truth (Moritz): Moritz has provided a Python script for the Raspberry Pi that exposes a local server via ngrok. This server has specific endpoints: /session/start, /session/stop, /zoom/preset, and /frame/next. He is asking for curl commands and access to test this entire client-to-hardware process.
Your Documentation (API.md, plan.md): Your API and architecture documents detail integrations with Supabase, Firebase, and Roboflow. There is no mention of the ngrok server or the Raspberry Pi API. The data flow diagrams completely omit the physical hardware component.
Impact: This is the most significant gap. The client application is not being built to communicate with the core hardware. Moritz cannot test his work, and the "real-time feedback" feature cannot be implemented as planned.
Discrepancy #2: Automated Distance Recognition (Expectation vs. Feasibility)
Ground Truth (Conversation): You correctly identify that classifying target distance (10m, 15m, etc.) is a complex new machine learning task. It would require a separate model, hundreds of new labeled images per distance, and could hurt performance.
Feature Roadmap (Gidi's Plan): The roadmap lists "Phase 2: Automated Distance Recognition" as a standard feature, which might imply it's a straightforward implementation.
Impact: There's a potential mismatch in perceived complexity. While not an immediate implementation error, it's crucial to align with your partners that this is a significant R&D effort, not a simple feature to be added. Your assessment in the conversation was spot-on and should be formally communicated.
Discrepancy #3: Session Start/Stop Flow (Plan vs. Implementation)
Ground Truth (Conversation): The proposed flow ("customer scans QR code -> web app sends API call to Pi to start session") was approved as "perfect."
Your Implementation: Given that the app is not yet connected to the Pi's API and the login is broken, this key user journey is not implemented.
Impact: This is the primary user workflow for initiating a session. Its absence, combined with the lack of API connectivity, means the core product loop is incomplete.
2. Feature Roadmap vs. Current Reality
Your documentation outlines an ambitious, multi-phased project. However, the current state of the application requires a sharp focus on fundamentals.
Your Focus: You have been meticulously rebuilding the app's foundation, focusing on a robust stack (Firebase, Supabase, shadcn/ui) and defining a scalable architecture. This is good long-term planning.
Partner's Focus (Gidi's Plan): The plan progresses from basic scoring (Phase 1) to AI-driven posture analysis and wind data (Phase 4).
The Reality: The app is currently struggling at "Phase 0": achieving a stable, logged-in state. Features from Phase 1, like real-time scoring, are blocked by the missing hardware API integration. Discussing Phase 4 features like wind data and posture analysis is premature until the core functionality of Phase 1 is operational.
3. Technical Debt and Current Blockers (Recap from Test Logs)
Your personal message about rebuilding the app from scratch explains the current instability. These known issues must be solved before any new features are added.
Critical Authentication Failure: As confirmed by the last test report (App.test.tsx failures), users cannot log in or access authenticated routes. This is the #1 blocker.
Unstable Test Environment: The incompatibility between JSDOM and your UI library (Radix UI) means you cannot reliably test your components, slowing down development and hiding bugs.
4. Prioritized Action Plan
To bridge the gap between your plan and your partners' needs, here is a revised, prioritized action plan.
Priority 0: Stabilize the Application (Immediate)
Fix Authentication: Resolve the MagicLogin integration issue. A user must be able to log in and see an authenticated dashboard. Nothing else matters until this works.
Fix Test Environment: Implement the JSDOM polyfills (hasPointerCapture, scrollIntoView) to stabilize your UI component tests. You cannot build reliably without a functioning test suite.
Priority 1: Integrate the Hardware API (Bridge the Gap)
Update Documentation: Immediately update API.md and plan.md to include the GMShooter Pi Server API as a core component. The architecture diagram must show the React client communicating with it.
Create a Hardware Service: In your React app, create a new service or hook (useHardware.ts?) dedicated to making requests to the ngrok URL. It should contain functions like startSession(fps), stopSession(), setZoomPreset(n), etc., matching Moritz's script.
Provide curl Commands: Once your service is drafted, you can provide Moritz with the exact curl commands he needs for testing (e.g., curl -X POST <your_ngrok_url>/session/start -H "ngrok-skip-browser-warning: true" -d '{"fps": 1}').
Priority 2: Implement the Core User Flow (Phase 1)
Build the Session Start UI: Implement the UI for the QR code scan result. This page should have a "Start Session" button.
Connect UI to Hardware: Wire the "Start Session" button to call the startSession() function in your new hardware service.
Fetch and Display Frames: Use the api_frame_next endpoint to fetch frames from the Pi and display them in the VideoAnalysis component. This will be the first time you see the full, end-to-end system working.
Priority 3: Manage Expectations and Refine the Roadmap
Clarify "Automated Distance": Formally document your technical assessment of the automated distance detection feature and discuss with Gidi to ensure the R&D effort is understood and correctly placed in the roadmap.
Focus on Phase 1: Communicate to your partners that all effort is currently focused on stabilizing the app and delivering the core Phase 1 functionality, which is now possible with the hardware API integration. Defer work on all other phases.
Of course. Here is a comprehensive redesign plan that integrates your excellent foundational work with your partners' practical requirements, creating a clear path forward for GMShoot.
Executive Summary: The Redesigned Plan
Your current architecture is well-documented but web-centric, focusing on a direct Client-to-Supabase/Roboflow connection. Your partner, Moritz, has developed a critical piece of hardware (the Pi server) that acts as the real-time "eyes" of the system. The redesign bridges this gap.
We will pivot to a Hardware-First Architecture. The React client will primarily communicate with the Pi server for all session-related activities (start, stop, zoom, frame fetching). The Pi server becomes the central orchestrator, capturing frames and sending them for analysis. Supabase will then be used for what it's best at: long-term storage, user data, and post-session reporting.
This approach directly addresses Moritz's needs, unblocks immediate end-to-end testing, and aligns with Gidi's phased roadmap by enabling Phase 1 (real-time feedback) immediately.
1. The New User Workflow
This workflow is simple, intuitive, and built around the hardware integration.
Authentication: User logs into the React web app using Firebase Auth (Google/Email). This remains unchanged. Your app syncs the user profile with the users table in Supabase.
Session Initiation (The "QR Code Moment"):
The user is at the shooting range. The Pi server is active and displaying a QR code on its local screen.
The user opens the GMShoot web app on their phone/tablet and scans the QR code.
The QR code contains the local ngrok URL and a unique session token for the Pi.
Real-Time Session:
The React app now has the Pi's address. The user sees a "Live Target View" screen.
User presses "Start Session". The React app sends a POST /session/start request to the Pi server.
The React app continuously fetches the latest frame via GET /frame/next from the Pi server and displays it.
The user can control the camera zoom via buttons in the UI, which send POST /zoom/preset requests to the Pi server.
Analysis & Feedback:
The Pi server, upon receiving a frame from the camera, sends it to the Roboflow API for inference.
Roboflow detects "hole" objects and returns JSON coordinates.
The React app overlays these predictions (as circles/labels) on the live video feed, giving the user instant visual feedback on their shots.
Session End & Reporting:
User presses "Stop Session". The React app sends POST /session/stop to the Pi server.
The Pi server finalizes the session data (all frames and predictions) and uploads it as a single package to a Supabase Edge Function.
This Edge Function processes the data, populates the analysis_sessions and analysis_results tables in Supabase, and generates an entry in the reports table.
Post-Session Review:
Later, the user can log in to the web app, navigate to their "Session History," and view a detailed, SOTA dashboard analyzing their performance.
2. The Analysis Stack: From Real-Time to Deep Insights
This stack is designed for both immediate feedback and powerful post-hoc analysis.

    end

    subgraph Authentication & User Data

        I -- Syncs Profile --> G;
    end
Key Components:
React Client: The user's interface. Manages state, controls the hardware, and visualizes real-time data.
Pi Server (Moritz's Code): The core orchestrator. Manages the camera, communicates with Roboflow, and serves frames to the client.
Roboflow API: The specialized vision model. Its only job is to detect "hole" coordinates from an image and return them fast.
Supabase (Backend & Data Warehouse): Handles user profiles, stores historical session data, and powers the analytical dashboards via Edge Functions and a PostgreSQL database.
3. UI Design: Actionable & Engaging Dashboard
Your UI should be clean, modern, and data-rich. Use your Spec-Kit and shadcn/ui foundation.
Live View Screen:
Main View: Large, clear video feed from the Pi.
Overlay: Non-intrusive circles/dots appear on the target for each detected shot. A "ghost" of the last 3-5 shots can remain visible.
Controls: Simple "Start/Stop" button. A slider or preset buttons for "Zoom Control."
Real-time Stats: A small, live-updating panel showing "Shots Fired," "Current Grouping Size," and "Time Elapsed."
SOTA Analytics Dashboard (Post-Session): This is where you deliver maximum value.
Shot Plot Heatmap: A visual representation of the target with a heatmap showing the density of all shots. This immediately shows the user's grouping tendency (e.g., consistently low and to the left).
Grouping Analysis:
Mean Point of Impact (MPI): The calculated center of the shot group.
Extreme Spread: The distance between the two furthest shots (measured in cm/inches).
Standard Deviation: A statistical measure of shot consistency.
Score Over Time Chart: A line chart showing the score of each shot throughout the session. This can reveal fatigue or performance trends. (Use the "scores of each session" chart example).
Shot Cadence Analysis: A bar chart showing the time between each shot. This helps analyze rhythm and consistency.
Shot Location Analysis (Bullseye Chart): A radar chart showing shot distribution across different rings of the target (e.g., 10-ring, 9-ring). This visualizes precision. (Use the "bullseye shots chart" example).
"What If" Scenarios: Allow the user to click on a "flyer" (an errant shot) and see how their grouping stats (MPI, spread) would improve if that shot were discounted. This is highly engaging.
Session Comparison: Allow users to select two sessions and view their heatmaps and key stats side-by-side to track progress over time.
4. Features List & Complete Plan
This plan prioritizes stabilizing the app and delivering the core end-to-end functionality first.
Phase 0: Stabilization & Foundation (1 Week)
Fix Authentication: Resolve the login issue. A user must be able to sign in successfully. (Highest Priority)
Fix Test Environment: Add JSDOM polyfills to get UI tests passing and reliable.
Implement Hardware Service: Create a services/HardwareAPI.ts module in React to handle all communication with the Pi's ngrok server.
Phase 1: End-to-End MVP (2 Weeks)
Implement Live View: Create the LiveTargetView component. It should:
Fetch and display frames from /frame/next.
Have functional "Start/Stop" and "Zoom" buttons that call the Hardware Service.
Implement Real-Time Overlay: Parse the prediction JSON received with each frame and draw circles on the canvas/video element.
Build Supabase Ingestion Function: Create the Supabase Edge Function that receives the session package from the Pi and populates the database.
Phase 2: Basic Analytics & History (2 Weeks)
Build Session History Page: Create the ReportList component that queries Supabase to show a user's past sessions.
Build Basic Report Page: For each session, display the final shot plot heatmap and key stats (Total Shots, Mean Point of Impact, Extreme Spread).
Phase 3: SOTA Dashboard & UI Polish (3 Weeks)
Implement Advanced Charts: Add the "Score Over Time," "Shot Cadence," and "Shot Location" charts to the report page.
Implement "What If" Feature: Add the interactive flyer-discounting functionality.
UI Overhaul: Integrate your MagicUI components and "Digital Serenity" design philosophy to polish the entire application, focusing on the landing page, login, and dashboard.
By following this plan, you directly address your partners' immediate needs while building upon your existing work to create a truly state-of-the-art, feature-rich application.

Excellent questions. You've hit on the three most critical architectural details that define how this system will actually work in practice. My apologies for not making these points clearer initially.
Let's break them down. You are 100% correct in your thinking on all three points, and this clarification will refine the plan to match your vision perfectly.
1. The Session Initiation Flow (The QR Code Explained)
You are right, the ultimate goal is for the app to control the session. The QR code's purpose is not to display information from the app, but to solve a fundamental networking problem:
The Problem: How does your web app, running on a tablet on the internet, discover and securely connect to a specific Raspberry Pi hardware device that is sitting on a local network at a shooting range?
The Pi's ngrok URL is dynamic and changes every time the Pi restarts. The QR code is the simplest and most secure way to perform this "device pairing" or "device discovery".
The Refined Workflow (Best of Both Worlds):
The Pi's Role (Device Identity):
The Pi boots up and starts its server.
It connects to ngrok, receiving a unique, temporary URL (e.g., https://random-chars.ngrok-free.app).
The Pi then displays this unique URL as a QR code on a small screen attached to it, or on the range's lane monitor. This QR code is the Pi's "business card" for this session.
The App's Role (Session Control):
You log into the GMShoot app on your tablet.
You are presented with a "Scan to Connect to Lane" button, which opens the camera.
You scan the QR code displayed at your shooting lane.
Now your app knows the secret address of the Pi (https://random-chars.ngrok-free.app).
Sending the Unique Session ID (Your Idea):
This is where your brilliant point comes in. Now that the app knows how to talk to the Pi, it doesn't just blindly start.
When you press "Start Session" in the app, the app first creates a unique session record in your Supabase analysis_sessions table and gets back a session_id.
The app then sends the POST /session/start request to the Pi's ngrok URL, but now it includes the unique session_id in the payload:
code
JSON
{
  "fps": 1,
  "session_id": "uuid-from-supabase-for-this-session"
}
The Pi now knows that all subsequent frames and analysis belong to this specific user and session.
Why this is the best approach: It's secure (the connection is initiated by physical presence), seamless for the user (no typing URLs), and allows your app to maintain full control by linking the physical hardware session to a specific user account record in your database from the very beginning.
2. The Real-Time Analysis Dashboard
You are absolutely right. The goal is a complete, live dashboard, not just a video feed. The "Live Target View" is your real-time dashboard.
During the live session, we can and should display a rich set of data that updates with every single shot. The dashboard will be composed of:
The Live Video Feed: The foundation of the view.
Shot Overlays: Instantaneous markers appear on the feed for each detected hit.
A Live Shot Counter: A simple number Shots: 8.
Last Shot Score: A prominent display showing the score of the most recent shot (e.g., Last Shot: 9.8).
Live Grouping Stats: A continuously updated calculation of:
Mean Point of Impact (MPI): A small crosshair on the target showing the center of the current shot group.
Group Size: The diameter of the smallest circle containing all shots so far (e.g., Grouping: 3.2 cm).
Live Session Trends (Your "SOTA Trends"): A mini line-chart showing the score of the last 10 shots. This gives the user immediate feedback on their consistency and whether they are trending up or down during the session.
The more computationally intensive analysis (historical comparisons, detailed heatmaps, "what-if" scenarios) is reserved for the post-session report to ensure the real-time dashboard remains fast and responsive.
3. The "Brain": From Stateless Frames to Sequential Shots
This is the most critical technical challenge, and you've identified it perfectly. Roboflow is stateless; it sees a frame with holes. We need to build a stateful "brain" that says, "This is Shot #1, this is Shot #2..."
This logic will reside on the Raspberry Pi server, as it's the component that communicates with Roboflow and has the complete picture.
Here is the algorithm for sequential shot detection:
Initialization: When a session starts (POST /session/start), the Pi server creates an empty list in its memory called confirmed_shots = [].
The Analysis Loop (for every frame):
The Pi grabs a frame and sends it to Roboflow.
Roboflow returns a list of detected "hole" predictions for that frame (e.g., [{x:100, y:102}, {x:350, y:345}]).
The Pi server then runs the "New Shot Identification" logic:
For each new_prediction from Roboflow:
It compares the coordinates of new_prediction to every shot already in the confirmed_shots list.
It calculates the distance. If the distance is less than a small threshold (e.g., 5-10 pixels), it assumes this is just another detection of an existing shot and ignores it.
If the new_prediction is not close to any existing shot in the confirmed_shots list, it is declared a NEW SHOT.
Confirming and Numbering a New Shot:
When a NEW SHOT is identified, the Pi server:
Assigns it a sequential number (e.g., shot_number: len(confirmed_shots) + 1).
Adds it to the confirmed_shots list with its coordinates, a timestamp, and its number. confirmed_shots now looks like: [{shot_number: 1, ...}, {shot_number: 2, ...}].
Sending Rich Data to the App:
The Pi server now sends a much richer JSON payload back to your React dashboard with every frame. It includes not just the frame image, but the full list of confirmed_shots.
Your React app can then render all confirmed shots with their numbers (1, 2, 3...) on the target.
How this enables your advanced features:
Sequential Report: At the end of the session, the Pi uploads the final, ordered confirmed_shots list to Supabase. Your report is automatically sequential.
SOTA Trends & Projection Lines: Because your React app receives the ordered list in real-time, you can easily calculate live trends. To create a projection line, you simply draw a line from the coordinates of confirmed_shots[N-1] to the coordinates of confirmed_shots[N]. This visualizes the user's adjustment from one shot to the next, exactly as you envisioned.

Of course. These are excellent, clarifying questions that get to the heart of the user experience and the technical implementation. You've provided a much richer vision for the app's interface and a critical constraint for the scoring logic.
Here are the direct answers, followed by a complete, refined plan that incorporates this new information.
Answers to Your Key Questions
1. On Session Initiation & The User Flow:
You are absolutely correct. The flow you outlined is superior and much more user-centric. The key insight is that the QR code's purpose isn't for the initial connection, but for transferring the live session to a user's personal device.
Why the Pi Server is "Always On": Moritz is right. The Pi is part of the range's infrastructure. It's always on, waiting for a user to start a session. This is stable and reliable.
The Refined QR Code Logic: When a user starts a session on the main tablet at the shooting lane, the app is in control. If that user wants to mirror the live dashboard on their own phone, the tablet can display a QR code. This QR code contains the Pi's ngrok URL and the active session_id. The user scans it with their phone, and their phone's browser instantly connects to the ongoing session. It's a "take it with you" feature, not a connection prerequisite.
Gamification (WoW Talent Tree): This is a brilliant, highly engaging idea. It transforms the app from a simple tool into a long-term progression system. We will build this into the plan as a key "retention" feature in a future phase.
2. On Scoring From a Fixed Camera (Without a New Model):
This is the most critical technical detail. With a fixed camera, we do not need another AI model. We can use a much faster and more reliable geometric/mathematical approach.
Here is how we determine the score from the example frame:
One-Time Calibration: During setup for each lane, we perform a simple calibration. We tell the system the exact pixel coordinates of the target's center (cx, cy) and the pixel radius of each scoring ring (e.g., ring_10_radius_px, ring_9_radius_px, etc.). This calibration data is stored and associated with that specific camera/lane.
The Scoring Algorithm:
Roboflow detects a new bullet hole and gives us its center coordinates (x, y).
The Pi server calculates the distance of the hole from the target's center using the Pythagorean theorem: distance_in_pixels = sqrt((x - cx)² + (y - cy)²).
The server then checks this distance against the calibrated ring radii:
If distance_in_pixels <= ring_10_radius_px, the score is 10.
Else if distance_in_pixels <= ring_9_radius_px, the score is 9.
...and so on.
Advanced Metrics ("What else can we do?"): With this system, we can unlock a huge range of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) analytics:
Time-Based Metrics: The Pi server timestamps every newly confirmed shot. This allows us to calculate:
Time to First Shot: Crucial for competitive readiness.
Split Times: The time elapsed between consecutive shots.
Cadence/Rhythm: The average time between shots in a session.
Grouping Metrics: We can calculate the mathematical center of all shots (Mean Point of Impact) and the distance between the two furthest shots (Extreme Spread). This is the gold standard for precision analysis.
The Full Refined Implementation Plan
This plan synthesizes all our discussions into a clear, phased roadmap, prioritizing stability, the core user experience, and your visionary gamification features.
The Complete User Journey (Redefined)
This is our "ground truth" flow that the entire technical plan will serve.
Launch & Login: A user (or range officer) opens the GMShoot app on the lane's tablet. They log into a pre-configured "Lane Account" or their personal account.
The Home Dashboard: The user is greeted by a dynamic home screen featuring their profile, XP bar, achievement notifications, and the "Talent Tree" showing their progress.
Start Session: The user navigates to the "Start New Session" screen. They select their firearm and ammo type from a predefined list (a feature from Gidi's plan). They press "Start".
Live Dashboard: The app transitions to the real-time analysis dashboard. The app creates a session in Supabase, gets a session_id, and sends the start command with this ID to the Pi server. The live feed begins.
Mobile Mirroring (Optional): The user can press a "View on Phone" icon, which generates a QR code on the tablet. They scan this with their phone to get the same live dashboard mirrored on their personal device.
Real-Time Analysis: As they shoot, the dashboard populates with live data: shot overlays, scores, grouping stats, and trend charts.
Stop Session: The user presses "Stop." The Pi finalizes the data and sends it to Supabase for permanent storage.
Instant Report & Gemini Advice: The app immediately displays a post-session summary report. It makes a call to a Gemini/LLM backend, feeding it the structured session data (scores, splits, grouping). Gemini returns a concise, personalized analysis and a "tip for next time."
The Technical Architecture (Refined)
This architecture supports the journey above, with clear responsibilities for each component.

Phase 0: Foundation & Stability (Immediate Priority: 1-2 Weeks)
Objective: Fix all critical blockers and establish a stable platform.
Tasks:
Fix Authentication: Resolve the MagicLogin issue completely. Ensure a user can log in, stay logged in, and access protected routes.
Fix Test Environment: Implement JSDOM polyfills. Get the test suite to a state where it reliably passes and can be trusted.
Hardware Service Implementation: Create the services/HardwareAPI.ts module in the React app to handle all communication with the Pi.
Phase 1: The Core Loop MVP (2 Weeks)
Objective: Achieve the first end-to-end, "bullet-to-browser" working prototype.
Tasks:
Implement Geometric Scoring on Pi: Moritz or you will add the scoring algorithm to the Pi server's Python script, using a static calibration file.
Implement Sequential Shot Detection on Pi: Add the logic to identify and number new shots.
Build Basic Live View: Create the React component that can start a session and display the live video feed with basic, un-styled shot overlays.
Backend Ingestion: Create the Supabase Edge Function to receive the final session data package from the Pi.
Phase 2: The SOTA Dashboard & Report (3 Weeks)
Objective: Deliver the core value proposition: a rich, real-time dashboard and insightful post-session analysis.
Tasks:
Build the Full Live Dashboard: Enhance the Live View with all the real-time metrics: live shot counter, last shot score, live MPI crosshair, group size, and the mini trend chart.
Build the Post-Session Report: Design the report page with the primary shot plot heatmap and all key SOTA metrics (MPI, Extreme Spread, Split Times, etc.).
Integrate Gemini: Create a secure backend function to call the Gemini API with structured session data and display the returned advice on the report page.
Phase 3: Gamification & User Engagement (4 Weeks)
Objective: Implement the progression and retention systems that make the app addictive and unique.
Tasks:

Build the WoW-Style Talent Tree: This is a major UI/UX task. Design three distinct "skill trees" (e.g., Precision, Speed, Consistency). Achievements grant "talent points" that users can spend to unlock visual badges, new chart types in their reports, or other cosmetic rewards in the tree.
Phase 4: Polish & Expansion
Objective: Refine the user experience and add secondary features.
Tasks:
Implement Mobile Mirroring: Add the "View on Phone" QR code generation feature.
Session History & Comparison: Build out the UI to view past sessions and compare two sessions side-by-side.
UI Overhaul with MagicUI: Conduct a full design pass to integrate advanced animations and ensure a polished, "Digital Serenity" feel across the entire application.

Of course. This is an excellent next step. You're feeling the friction of a cluttered project and the uncertainty of not having a clear, up-to-date test report. We'll address this systematically.

The plan is to **cleanse, test, and then build**. This will give you a stable, organized foundation and a clear picture of your project's health before you write any new feature code.

Here is the revised plan for your agent.

---

### Revised Plan: Project Cleansing, Full Test Audit, and TDD Implementation

**Objective:** To organize the GMShoot v2 repository, establish a definitive baseline of its current test status, and then proceed with the core analysis feature development using a test-driven approach with `cy.prompt()`.

**Branch:** `feature/project-cleanse-and-test`

---

### **Phase 1: Project Organization & Cleansing**

**Goal:** To remove clutter, organize files logically, and establish a clean, professional repository structure. This makes the project easier to navigate and maintain.

1.  **Initialize Specify:**
    *   **Command:** `/speckit.init --here --force`
    *   **Purpose:** To formally establish the Spec-Driven Development structure within the existing repository, ensuring all future work follows a consistent pattern.

2.  **Analyze and Reorganize Project Structure:**
    *   **Action:** The agent will analyze the entire project directory. It will identify and move misplaced files, and delete unused or redundant files.
    *   **Key Reorganization Tasks:**
        *   **Consolidate Tests:** Ensure all Jest/RTL unit tests are located within the `src/__tests__` directory and all Cypress E2E tests are within the `cypress/` directory. No test files should be at the root level.
        *   **Standardize Component Structure:** All reusable React components should be in `src/components/`. If using `shadcn/ui`, they will be in `src/components/ui/`. Page-level components should be in `src/pages/`.
        *   **Organize Utilities & Services:** All non-component logic should be organized into `src/hooks/`, `src/services/`, and `src/utils/`.
        *   **Clean Root Directory:** The root directory should be clean, containing only configuration files (`package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, etc.), `src/`, `public/`, `cypress/`, and the new `specs/` directory. Any stray `.js`, `.ts`, `.log` or `.md` files that are not part of the core configuration should be moved or deleted.
        *   **Documentation Consolidation:** Move all existing `.md` planning files (`tasks.md`, `plan.md`, `spec.md` from the root) into an `archive/` folder inside the new `specs/` directory to preserve them without cluttering the main workspace.

**Checkpoint:** The project directory is now clean, logically organized, and easy for any developer to understand.

### **Phase 2: Full Test Suite Execution & Reporting**

**Goal:** To get an unbiased, comprehensive report of the current state of all tests in the project. This will be our definitive baseline.

1.  **Fix CI/CD Pipeline (Prerequisite):**
    *   **Action:** Execute the "Repairing the CI/CD Pipeline" plan from our previous conversation. This is essential to ensure that the test environment is configured correctly.
    *   **File to modify:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

2.  **Execute Jest/RTL Unit & Integration Tests:**
    *   **Command:** The agent will run `npm test`.
    *   **Output Required:** The agent must provide the complete, unabridged console output from the Jest test run. This output must include:
        *   A summary of passing, failing, and skipped tests.
        *   For every failing test, the detailed error message, including the file path, line number, and assertion failure.
        *   The final test coverage report.

3.  **Execute Cypress E2E Tests:**
    *   **Command:** The agent will run `npm run cypress:run`.
    *   **Output Required:** The agent must provide:
        *   The summary table from the Cypress console output, showing which spec files passed and failed.
        *   For every failing test, the detailed error message from the console.
        *   A confirmation that test videos and screenshots for failed tests have been generated in the `cypress/videos/` and `cypress/screenshots/` directories.

**Checkpoint:** We have a complete and definitive report of the project's test health. We know exactly which tests are failing and why.

### **Phase 3: Test-Driven Development of Core Analysis with `cy.prompt()`**

**Goal:** To implement the core analysis feature using the 5 static test frames, driven by a new, cutting-edge E2E test using `cy.prompt()`.

1.  **Create the Mock Hardware Service (Unchanged):**
    *   **Action:** Implement the `src/services/MockHardwareAPI.ts` as described in the previous plan. This service will cycle through the 5 frames in `public/test_videos_frames/`. Ensure it's controlled by the `VITE_USE_MOCK_HARDWARE` environment variable.

2.  **Write the `cy.prompt()` E2E Test:**
    *   **Action:** Create a new test file: `cypress/e2e/prompt_driven_analysis.cy.ts`.
    *   **Implementation:** Inside this file, the agent will use `cy.prompt()` to describe the entire user journey for testing the static analysis pipeline.

    ```typescript
    // In cypress/e2e/prompt_driven_analysis.cy.ts
    
    describe('Prompt-Driven Static Analysis Pipeline', () => {
      it('should cycle through 5 test frames and display the correct analysis for each', () => {
        // --- Test Setup ---
        // Intercept the Supabase function call to provide mock analysis data
        cy.fixture('analysis_results.json').then((results) => {
          cy.intercept('POST', '**/functions/v1/analyze-frame', (req) => {
            // Find the correct analysis result based on the frame ID sent in the request
            const frameId = req.body.frameId; 
            const result = results.find(r => r.frameId === frameId);
            req.reply(result);
          }).as('analyzeFrame');
        });

        // --- Test Execution using cy.prompt() ---
        cy.prompt([
          "visit the session page",
          "wait for the first test frame image '1.svg' to be visible",
          "assert that the analysis overlay contains the score '9.8'",
          "wait for the second test frame image '2.svg' to be visible",
          "assert that the analysis overlay contains the score '8.5'",
          "wait for the third test frame image '3.svg' to be visible",
          "assert that the analysis overlay contains the score '10.0'",
          "wait for the fourth test frame image '4.svg' to be visible",
          "assert that the analysis overlay contains the score '7.2'",
          "wait for the fifth test frame image '5.svg' to be visible",
          "assert that the analysis overlay contains the score '9.1'",
        ]);
      });
    });
    ```

3.  **Run the `cy.prompt()` Test:**
    *   **Action:** The agent will execute *only* this new test file (`npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/prompt_driven_analysis.cy.ts"`).
    *   **Expected Result:** The test will **fail**, because the frontend logic to call the analysis function and display the results has not been written yet. This is the core of TDD.

4.  **Implement Frontend Logic to Make the Test Pass:**
    *   **Action:** The agent will now modify the frontend code (`src/hooks/useHardware.ts` and `src/components/LiveTargetView.tsx`) to implement the full pipeline:
        1.  Fetch the frame from the `MockHardwareAPI`.
        2.  Call the Supabase `analyze-frame` function.
        3.  Display the result in the UI.
    *   The agent will re-run the `cy.prompt()` test iteratively until it **passes**.

5.  **Final Deliverable:**
    *   **Action:** Once the test passes, the agent will provide the final passing test report and the screenshots captured by Cypress during the run.
    *   **Your Role:** You will then analyze these screenshots to visually confirm that the UI and the analysis overlay meet your design expectations.

This revised plan provides a structured, professional workflow that addresses all your concerns. It cleans the house, gets a clear report card on existing quality, and then uses the most modern testing approach to build the next critical feature.
