# GMShoot Project Constitution

## Development Principles

1. **User Experience First**: Always prioritize the user experience with smooth animations, intuitive navigation, and responsive design.

2. **Code Quality**: Maintain clean, readable, and well-documented code with proper TypeScript types and component structure.

3. **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading times and smooth interactions, especially for video analysis features.

4. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and data protection using Firebase for authentication and Supabase for data storage.

5. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive testing for all features, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## Technical Standards

1. **Component Architecture**: Use React with TypeScript, following functional component patterns with hooks.

2. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling across the application.

3. **State Management**: Use React hooks for local state and consider Context API or Redux for global state as needed.

4. **API Integration**: Implement proper error handling and loading states for all API calls.

5. **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all user-facing components.

## Workflow Guidelines

1. **Spec-Driven Development**: Follow the Spec-Kit workflow of specifying requirements before implementation.

2. **Incremental Development**: Build features in small, testable increments.

3. **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed before merging.

4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated with feature changes and API updates.
